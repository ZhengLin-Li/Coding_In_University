<div id="article" class="content" style=""><p>Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class.</p>
    <p>MALE PROFESSOR: Now astronomy didn't really balloon into the science it is today until the development of
        spectroscopy.</p>
    <p>Spectroscopy is basically the study of spectra and spectral lines of light,</p>
    <p>and specifically for us, the light from stars.</p>
    <p>It makes it possible to analyze the light emitted from stars.</p>
    <p>When you analyze this light,</p>
    <p>you can figure out their distance from the earth, and identify what they are made of,</p>
    <p>determine their chemical composition.</p>
    <p>Before we get into that though,</p>
    <p>it's probably a good thing to back up a bit.</p>
    <p>You all know how when you take a crystal prism and pass a beam of sunlight through it,</p>
    <p>you get a spectrum, which looks like a continuous band of rainbow colors.</p>
    <p>The light that we see with our human eyes as a band of rainbow color </p>
    <p>falls in a range of what's called visible light.</p>
    <p>And visible light spectroscopy is probably the most important kind of spectroscopy.</p>
    <p>Anyone want to take a stab at the scientific term for visible light?</p>
    <p>And I'm sure all of you know this because you all did the reading for today</p>
    <p>FEMALE STUDENT: Optical radiation. </p>
    <p>But I thought being exposed to radiation is dangerous.</p>
    <p>MALE PROFESSOR: Yes, and no.</p>
    <p>If you are talking about radiation, like in the element Uranium, </p>
    <p>yeah, that's dangerous. </p>
    <p>But radiation as a general term </p>
    <p>actually refers to anything that spreads away from its source.</p>
    <p>So optical radiation is just visible light energy spreading out.</p>
    <p>OK, so we've got a spectrum of a beam of sunlight and it looks like the colors bleed into each other.</p>
    <p>There are no interruptions, </p>
    <p>just a band flowing from violet to green, to yellow, to?? you get the idea.</p>
    <p>Well, what happens if the sunlight's spectrum is magnified?</p>
    <p>Maybe you all didn't do the reading.</p>
    <p>Well, here's what you'd see.</p>
    <p>I want you to know this that this spectrum is interrupted by dark lines called spectral lines.</p>
    <p>If you really magnify the spectrum of the sunlight,</p>
    <p>you could identify more than 100,000 of them.</p>
    <p>They may look like kind of randomly placed,</p>
    <p>but they actually form many distinct patterns.</p>
    <p>And if you were looking at the spectrum of some other star,</p>
    <p>the colors would be the same.</p>
    <p>But the spectral lines would break it up at different places, making different patterns.</p>
    <p>Each pattern stands for a distinct chemical element,</p>
    <p>and so different sets or patterns of spectral lines mean that the star has a different chemical composition.</p>
    <p>FEMALE STUDENT: So how do we know which spectral patterns match up with which elements?</p>
    <p>MALE PROFESSOR: Well, a kind of spectroscopic library of elements was compiled using flame tests.</p>
    <p>A known element, say a piece of iron for example, is heated in a pure gas flame.</p>
    <p>The iron eventually heats to the point that it radiates light.</p>
    <p>This light is passed through a prism,</p>
    <p>which breaks it up into a spectrum.</p>
    <p>And a unique pattern,</p>
    <p>kind of like a chemical fingerprint of spectral lines for that element appears.</p>
    <p>This process was repeated over and over again for many different elements,</p>
    <p>so we can figure out the chemical makeup of another star by comparing the spectral pattern it has</p>
    <p>to the pattern of the elements in the library.</p>
    <p>Oh, an interesting story about how one of the elements was discovered through spectroscopy.</p>
    <p>There was a pretty extensive library of spectral line patterns of elements even by the 1860s.</p>
    <p>A British astronomer was analyzing a spectrograph of sunlight,</p>
    <p>and he noticed a particular pattern of spectral lines that didn't match anything in the library.</p>
    <p>So he put two and two together,</p>
    <p>and decided there was an element in the sun that hadn't been discovered here on the earth yet.</p>
    <p>Any guesses about what that element is?</p>
    <p>It actually turned out to be pretty common and I'm sure all of you know it.</p>
    <p>OK. Let's try something else.</p>
    <p>Any of you happened to be familiar with the Greek word for "sun" by chance?</p>
    <p>MALE STUDENT: Something like "Helius" or something like that.</p>
    <p><span class="pRed">Oh it must be "Helium". So you are saying that helium was discovered on the sun first.</span>
    </p>
    <p>MALE PROFESSOR: Yes, and this is a good example of how important spectroscopy is in astronomy. </p></div>
